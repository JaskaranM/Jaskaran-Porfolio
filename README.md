# Jaskaran-Portfolio
A collection of my projects that I have created in my spare time to learn new concepts, tools, strategies and techniques.

## Portfolio
After experimenting with different fields of computer science, I discovered that I felt at home with cybersecurity, more specifically, blue team. To learn more about the details, I dedicated myself to create projects that interested me and would allow me to gain the kind of experience needed in job roles such as SOC anaylst and incident response. This lead me to research tools, how they worked with each other and how the process would look like in a live environmnet. This portfolio is a collection of my projects which cover different aspects of cybersecurity and have further fueled my passsion for this field.

I created two virtual machines, one with Kali Linux and another with Windows 10, and demonstrated how exposed ports are targeted and used msfvenom to create malware that allowed to gain access to the Windows machine's command line. I then demonstrated on the Windows 10 machine how suspicious events can raise flags.

The goal of this project was to demonstrate how something like a port be used as an attack vector for malware and could have devastating effects.
